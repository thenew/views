<h2 data-content='Alien'>Alien</h2>

It's not a secret, the introduction sequence of Alien, 8th passenger is remqrkable. Ridley Scott decided to spend 10minutes of the film wandering in a n empty spacecship
It's fitting perflectly the story as the story begins by a unanticipited wakeup. we just witness a few minutes before.
The sequence showcases the amsing production design, ron cobb, icons by Moebius. Even using tehnologies from the time of the filiming, this aestetics became timeless, known as retrofuturism.
The production was so thought and the fact that the director took the time to share and enjoy the art of the desighn team is wonderful.
3minutes in fact, it sounds short on paper

The cinematography is splendid, the type design of the credits is timeless, the long shots are mastered, it's zemekiss of course. He's not afraid of cuting the long takes when needed.
It's foreshadowing the plot, depicting the film's subject: time
and the scene ends with an explosion of 80s Power of love and skateboard.

<h2 data-content='Speed Racer'>Speed Racer</h2>

The Wachowskys proved their editing skills with Cloud of Atlas and even, Sense8, but Speed Racer is still their most flamboyant example. And especially the introduction. Alterning between a present scene where Speed is racing alone against his browser's ghost, figuratively because he left the house and litterally as a video game race ghost like. and flashbacks presenting Speed.
The -flawless- alternation is classic but the most vivify is the cresendo. The tension is building up and I'm just hooked until the last part. Though to follow up on this but the film is showing hidden ressources.
17 minutes non stop

<h2 data-content='Booksmart'>Booksmart</h2>

I'm just a sucker for the line from X in the car, and the stupidely free dance moves after. The cameo of Y is the cherry on the cake.


<h2 data-content='Kung fu panda'>Kung fu panda</h2>

I'm a geek for animation and I was in school when the film came out. One of my  
I studied this animated introduction and try to copied it. It reminds me the work of Tarkakovski on Samurai Jack but with even more time and or budget. This balance between traditional 2d animation and computer particles and clothes animation has been rarely matched.
This intro just overcame the rest of the film, which is high quality but just another 3D animation style.

<h2 data-content='Reservoir Dogs'>Reservoir Dogs</h2>

The Tip talk, a debate which stays with me until today. I don't tip and back then, when I watched the film, ai didn't even know what a tip was.
Mondaine talk with random people, starts like a down to earth movie until the opening fades into M. X bleeding and mouning in the backseat. 
Just small details, the suits, M. Pink, the killing joke.

Edited every one of Quentin Tarantino's films until her death in 2010 Sally Menke
Then the cult opening of the men in black walking in the alley with a bad slow mo. The Tarantino openings aesthetic is already in place.
I'm hooked.

<h2 data-content='The Graduate'>The Graduate</h2>

Tarantino has a lot of memorable opening scenes, the one from Jacky Brown is the same as the one from The Graduate (1967). Simon & Garfunkel's music, unzoom in plane and "one shot" on the trailing.
And the film ends with an incredible last shot, mixing hope, jubilation and meaninglessness, reprising the Sound of Silence. Others example of mirrored music


<h2 data-content='Arrival'>Arrival</h2>

Max Richter. The trivia is that it was a temp track but Johanson didn't get Villeneuve to replace it.
The end reflecting the beginning is an easy way to close a story but match smartly the idea behind the alien language.

<h2 data-content='Watchmen'>Watchmen</h2>

Slow motion
Mixing the opening credits with a music is often a pleasure
and it's maybe the only original addition in this adaption to the comics

<h2 data-content='Apocalypse Now'>Apocalypse Now</h2>

The Door, This is the end for a opening sequence lol

<h2 data-content='Tron legacy'>Tron legacy</h2>

I love the soundtrack by Daft Punk
My favorite part of this film is everything outside the computer and mainly the beginning, the instalment of the story and what happens since the first episode.

<h2 data-content='Mr Right'>Mr Right</h2>

This music is magic, and Sam Rockwell's dance moves tasty.
