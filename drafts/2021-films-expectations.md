![Dune film](/assets/2021films/dune.jpg)

This year, I’ve been a bit overboard with 52 movies.
All those films should be released in 2021 but we don’t know any more, so the dates are just . And, of course, 14 are coming from [http://views.thenew.fr/posts/2020-films-expectations/](my post of last year). Some novelties: HBO Max is becoming a new channel at the expense of Denis Villeneuve.  
For my second time, I’m sure my reviews will be even closer to this list.
