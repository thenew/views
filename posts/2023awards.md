description: All manga, films, music, TV and games I liked in 2023. It took me two months to write this review of last year, so it should worth it.

This year has been remarkable in the field of art. We had the new: Fincher, Mario (a film and a game!), Zelda, Nolan, Street Fighter, Chazelle, Scorsese, Miyazaki (while I was in Japan!), Bethesda RPG, Wes Anderson, Michael Mann, Damon Lindelof, Spielberg, Daft Punk and The Beatles (?!), Aronofsky, Indiana Jones, and the list goes on!

I watched 90 films in 2023, including 38 films in theaters (in 5 different cities) and 33 films released this year.

I hope it was the last year for the multiverse trend (think about _The Flash_, _Spider-Man_, and the _MCU_) while another annoying trend seems to start: the surprising two-parts movies: _Dune_, _Spider-Man_, _Fast X_, _City Hunter_ and _M:I 7_ who even drops the “part one” for the digital release.

The year was more than great in cinema, I would strongly recommend every film in my top 20. And I loved the crazy summer streak at the end of July: _Barbenheimer_, _Slam Dunk_, _Spider-Man_, _Elemental_, _Asteroid City_, _M:I 7_ and _Indiana Jones 5_.

- 🏆 _The First Slam Dunk_
  I'm not a reader of _Slam Dunk_, I don't watch basketball, I'm not a fan of this 3D animation style and yet, the film took me away. The soundtrack and the editing is amazing. It's the best sports film in a long time.

- 🥈 _Barbie_
  It was maybe my most enjoyable screening, I laughed a lot, it was a jolly crowd and the walk in a sunny Westerpark after the film was the cherry on the cake.
  The film is not perfect, it takes a lot from _The Lego Movie_, Ken is more interesting than Barbie, supporting roles are a waste but there are many good jokes and I listened to the soundtrack for months.

### Mentions

- Too many other mentions, so rapid fire: _Perfect Days_ gave me chills with simple things; I loved Brendan Fraser comeback; it's a miracle _Mars Express_ exists and Justin Hurwitz is on a perfect winning streak!

<h2 data-content='Web video'>Web video</h2>

In 2023, I watched even more videos on Youtube and Twitch (277 days, compared to 228 last year). Mostly French content, like [Etienne et Antoine](https://www.youtube.com/@etienneetantoine), a super interesting dive into stand-up comedy, but also:

- I discovered and even subscribed to [Dropout](http://dropout.tv) with shows like _Game Changer_, _Make some noise_, _Total forgiveness_ and _Hum actually_.

- I continue to watch [_Saturday Night Live_](https://www.youtube.com/@SaturdayNightLive) on Youtube every week.
  If you don't know _Please don't destroy_ group, it is the best thing that happened to the show recently.
  Overall, the quality depends a lot on the host but you can still trust Emma Stone and Adam Driver to deliver great performances, my favorites skits of the year:
  - [Make Your Own Kind of Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2710NcijHY)
  - [Airplane Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yyq5C4Hu8Y)
  - [Question Quest](https://youtu.be/kq8Xlbb3bOw)

</div>

I had two songs on repeat in 2023 and their music videos are also great:

- 🏆 _Tokyo Calling_ - Atarashii Gakko!
  I've never fallen for a J-Pop band before, but they became an obsession. I also recommend these other videos: [OTONABLUE / THE FIRST TAKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MNPt-zlz-8), [SEISHUN WO KIRISAKU HADO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5Su2XQX3yI) and [**新しい学校のリーダーズ ｢キミワイナ'17｣**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mElVGBvP2c)

</a>

- 🥈 _With Or Without You_ - Pacifica
  I was following [Inés Adam](https://www.youtube.com/@InesAdam)’s videos before she formed the band Pacifica and their first single is a super cool variant of The Strokes. I was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of the video as well.

### Mentions

This year, we also got the last songs and videos from The Beatles and Daft Punk:

- _Infinity Repeating_ is just a demo but still a good earworm and it gave a chance for Warren Fu to deliver a gem of a video for animation lovers.
  Don't miss the [making of series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSdoVPM5Wnnd2drD-3f6o2mftZdsvSMwe).

</a>

- _Now and Then_ is the first track of The Beatles since 1996 and possibly their last. It is a very nice song and the music video by Peter Jackson is so bad I like it. The [short making of](https://youtu.be/APJAQoSCwuA) is even more interesting.

By the way, I discovered on The Beatles' Youtube channel this beautiful music video from last year for [I'm Only Sleeping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XwXliCK19Y). With an [interview of the artist Em Cooper](<[https://youtu.be/F362nZHoVVg](https://youtu.be/F362nZHoVVg?si=EcwZX2-z0BuLPwtD)>)

[![screenshot of Marathon](/assets/2023awards/marathon.png)](/assets/2023awards/marathon.png)

</div>

- 🏆 _Marathon_
  Without any doubt, the trailer have watched the most, for the art direction, the music, the project (Bungie's new game) and the editing.
  Produced by [Antibody](https://antibody.tv/works/marathon-announcement-trailer/) (art director [Joseph Cross](https://www.artstation.com/josephacross)) with an original SebastiAn remix of _Heavy Metal_ by Justice, managed by [The Elements Music](https://www.theelementsmusic.com/projects/marathon-official-announcement-trailer). I would love to have more behind the scenes about the audio and the video.

### Mentions

- _The War Within Announce Cinematic | World of Warcraft_
  Crazy to see the evolution of Blizzard and WoW trailers, the more technically impressive they become the less action they have.

- _EXODUS_
  Classic sci-fi universe, but the trailer is made by the amazing [Blur studio](https://blur.com/projects/exodus).

### WTF

The WTF award goes to the first look video for E*verybody 1-2-Switch!*. So Bad they removed their video, but I find a mirror link: https://youtu.be/wt2B1iMIvcY

</a>

<h2 data-content='TV'>TV</h2>

- 🏆 _Shrinking_
  The new series from Bill Lawrence, after _Scrubs_ and _Ted Lasso_, shares all the things I love about its predecessors: a good balance of comedy and drama, a great indie rock soundtrack and a great cast.

- 🥈 _Scavengers Reign_
  I didn't even finish it but a sci-fi animated show with this style is everything I wanted. In addition to its visual, the show is touching, like rarely seen before, on the true nature of xenobiology.

### Mentions

- _The Last of Us_ was a surprisingly good video game adaptation, HBO is still the best seal of approval. Like everyone, I loved the standalone third episode.

Then, we had a good second season for _The Afterparty_, a intriging first season for _The Big Door Prize_.
Solid ongoing seasons for _Star Trek: Strange New Worlds_, _Foundation_, _Parlement_ (a funny multilingual show about the European politics I always recommend) and, sadly cancelled, _Our Flag Means Death_.

</div>

No remarkable TV or movie trailer to highlight this year but a lot of the big movies had very good trailers: [_TMNT_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooZdaF2zMlM), [_Asteroid City_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW88VBvQaiI), [_The Creator_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=573GCxqkYEg), [_Ferrari_](<[https://youtu.be/KZHxT2yb2cE](https://youtu.be/KZHxT2yb2cE?si=vylimf-JTewwJuwo)>), [_Mars Express_](<[https://youtu.be/7iroDVDTPco](https://youtu.be/7iroDVDTPco?si=yBssTZ4j_NCQwHWd)>). I especially love the “Can you find the wolves in this picture?” line in the [_Killers of the Flower Moon_ trailer](https://youtu.be/EG0si5bSd6I), playing with the edit compared to the film.

The teaser who got me the most curious was [_Tár_](https://youtu.be/nXK-tqy3QS0), with a lot of images that are not in the film at the end, we need more of this.

Finally, the trailer for [_Mrs. Davis_](https://youtu.be/PIOnrEujKl8), the new show from Damon Lindelof, totally threw me off. I have to watch it!

<h2 data-content='Video Game'>Video Game</h2>

A bit of a weird year: I finally finished the best game of 2015: _The Witcher 3_ with 51h, and played 50h of another game from 2015: _Starfield_ :D

I also started playing The New York Times games: the famous Wordle, the historical crossword and the new _Connections_, a blatant copy of the British show _Only Connect_, which didn't stop it from being one of the most Googled games in 2023.

From 2023, I liked _F-Zero 99_, _The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_ and _Street Fighter 6_.
Also worth mentioning: _Jusant_ and _Hi-Fi Rush_ were welcome surprises.
