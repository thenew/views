After collecting my favorite art pieces of 2024, I realised that one color tied them all together: the color of the burning fire, the dazzling and silent desert, but also of the gold medal and the enthusiasm of youth. In a year that has seen many dark ideologies, such as the false promises of thinking machines, pushed even further, let's hope the worm will turn and we'll see the sunlight.

![Civil War](/assets/2024awards/civil-war.png)

</div>

There's too much to say about cinema in 2024:
The omnipresence of A24, the phantom comeback of musicals I've all missed (_Joker: Folie à Deux_, _Emilia Pérez_ and _Wicked_). Adam Driver continues his strange career by starring in two films from legendary directors with complicated financing and results (_Ferrari_ and _Megalopolis_). The _Rebel Moon_ disaster. The directorial debut of my favorite Jake Johnson (_Self Reliance_). The emergence of Cailee Spaeny. A sequel to _Gladiator_ and _Beetlejuice_? A remake of _Road House_? The real farewell of Jim Carrey?

I saw a lot of good films from this year. I would recommend most of them. And above all my best 2024 film:

- 🏆 _Civil War_
  I saw it twice in cinema, which I rarely do, and it was a ride both times. I love everything about this film, I can't find anything to remove. _Civil War_ is the sum of Alex Garland's previous works (_Ex Machina_, _Annihilation_, _Devs_, _Men_). The story is more realistic and straightforward while the atmosphere remains eerie.
  The film gives just enough clues about this war to make everyone debate about it. I think it's simple and clear enough but it's funny how much people are arguing.
  Ultimately, it's a film about war photography and makes us experience the constant dilemma of a photographer.
  The music choices seem out of place and yet fits perfectly, I still listen to the soundtrack to this day.

- 🥈 _The Zone of Interest_
  All the arty choices from Jonathan Glazer (cinematography, music) are perfectly designed to fit and enhance the difficult subject. I've never felt that much the pettiness of the Nazis. And like the rest of the film, the final speaks volumes without saying anything. It's unsettling.

### Mentions

- _Poor things_
  I'm a Yórgos Lánthimos curious, but not a fan. I think this is his best film, for the costumes and the performances of Emma Stone and Mark Rufalo alone, the rest is off-putting. I simply hate the music and most of cinematography's choices. But the film is funny and occasionally pretty.
  Seeing the path Lánthimos was taking, I got excited for his next film _Kinds of Kindness_, also released in 2024, and the fall has been furious.

- _Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga_ and _Dune: Part Two_ are the two desert action films of the year, in diametrically opposite styles.

- _The Wild Robot_ is a solid film that manages all its emotional moments perfectly.

- _The Iron Claw_ is a good tragedy about brotherhood and the real story is even worse. Don't be put off by the casting like I was. Trust A24 :D

I could also mention the very good _Love Lies Bleeding_ and _Society of the Snow_ (La sociedad de la nieve).

<p style="text-align:center;color:var(--color);">❧</p>

I watched 114,5 films in 2024 (the half is the first part of the 7 hours long _Napoléon vu par Abel Gance)_, including 42 films in theatre (27 recent ones and 14 more or less vintage, thanks to the amazing programs of indie cinemas in Amsterdam, especially [Lab111](https://www.lab111.nl/)).

I saw two of my favorite films in the cinema, for the first time, this year: _Porco Rosso_ and _Speed Racer_. I could have completed the podium if the new release of _Interstella 5555_ had not been a sloppy AI upscale.

I’ve started the year with _Calmos_ and ended with _Climax_, two French films that almost sound the same, but are very different.

</div>

I often forget title sequences in my awards, but I love this art format. Two bad news: one of the best ressource online, [Art of the Title](https://www.artofthetitle.com/), is looking for funding, and I don't have many titles that I enjoyed to list here this year.

- 🏆 _DAN DA DAN_ Opening - _Otonoke_ by Creepy Nuts
  When you the most hyped studio _Science Saru_ (_Scott Pilgrim Takes Off_, _INU-OH_) adapts a great manga with a new track by Creepy Nuts, you get a pretty good result.
  I was happy to discover Creepy Nuts in 2024. Even if everyone already knew them since _Bling‐Bang‐Bang‐Born_ for the [opening of MASHLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLW35YMzELE), by the way, I recommend the live version on [THE FIRST TAKE channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6FUBWGSOIc).

</a>
<br />

- 🥈 _John Mulaney Presents: Everybody's In L.A._
  I was surprised by the quality of the opening credits for this weird series. Like [Kyle Hilliard](https://x.com/KyleMHilliard/status/1791121014685827210) put it, it’s such a good _GTA_ trailer.

### Mentions

A quick mention for the _Fallout_ TV show: it's always a good idea to have a short animated logo. They reminded me of the ones from Watchmen\_ TV miniseries. But, most interestingly, the ending titles, different on each episode, are quiet classy while being a subtle reminder of the video game.

<h2 data-content='Music video'>Music video</h2>

- 🏆 _Danza Marilù_ (feat. Fabiana Martone) - L'Impératrice
  We need more elder ladies dancing and having adventures!

### Mentions

After my best 2023 music video, Atarashii Gakko! keeps on delivering funky videos: _Toryanse_ and _Fly High_.

I usually hate puppets (I don't know why), but this video for _Content 4 U_ is fun and the song is so catchy. I'm looking forward to see TWRP live in 2025!

<div class="full-width">

![Olympics](/assets/2024awards/olympics.png)

</div>

For once, I added Sports in my year review, but I had the chance to assist to many competitions of the **Paris 2024 Olympic Games**. Rugby sevens in the _Stade de France_, beach volleyball in front of the Eiffel Tower, archery, tennis table and more. I also had the chills experiencing my first French anthem in a stadium, for a field hockey game against the Netherlands.

As a side project, I had fun listing all nation uniforms I could found on [ococo.thenew.fr](http://ococo.thenew.fr/)

- Another exceptional, and more unexpected, experience was to support my small hometown club, L'Union Saint Jean FC, in Toulouse Stadium. They played against a top club, AS Monaco, for the French national cup, during the Christmas holidays. There was no miracle, but I was a really nice moment to experience with my family.

- On a more personal level, I continue to enjoy playing in my football club, with some good results as well.

<h2 data-content='Live music'>Live music</h2>

Funny that I can’t set a winner in a live category, but if I would, [_Puggy_](https://puggyband.com/) would be my top of the year. I listened to their songs so much, I was delighted to see them coming to Amsterdam. Check out this Belgian pop-rock band if you don't know them, thet deserve to be more famous.

Another long time waiting: I saw _Max Richter_ in Luxembourg. I was supposed to see him in Paris in 2020 but it was cancelled because of covid.

I was happy to see [my discovery from last year](https://views.thenew.fr/posts/2023awards): _Atarashii Gakko!_. I was suprised by the number of fans.

_Hania Rani_ in Paradiso was also a remarkable event.

Another type of experience, less enthusiastic, was the new _L’imperatrice_ tour, with a new singer (the original singer Flore Benguigui left because of serious disagreements with the rest of the band).

<h2 data-content='Video game'>Video game</h2>

This year, I have played and finished many more games than usual. Let's start with the best games of the year:

<div class="full-width">

[![Artwork of Prince of Persia The Lost Crown](/assets/2024awards/pop.png)](/assets/2024awards/pop.png)

</div>

- 🏆 _Prince of Persia The Lost Crown_
  I just wanted to try it because it was in the _Ubisoft+_ subscription on Xbox and got sucked in for 23 hours. A perfect recipe of Metroidvania for me, more linear. I was very surprised by the diversity of biomes and powers. And the shonen spirit in the cutscenes was a nice touch.

- 🥈 _Balatro_
  It’s the surprise of the year for everyone. I can’t deny the talent in the mechanics and the satisfaction of the game feel, but the game is not as deep as people pretend. Still, I enjoyed it a lot, not bad considering I first came just for the shader animations.

- 🥈 _Helldivers II_
  Blasting democracy, with friends, upon bugs that were minding their own business is a blast. The definitive unofficial adaption of the masterpiece _Starship Troopers_.

### Mentions

- _Star Wars Outlaws_ is a bit broken, but is more fun the more you play it, despite a rocky start. I'll definitely finish it in 2025. With two good games, is 2024 Ubisoft's swan song?

- _Pacific Drive_ is too long for its own good, I finished it after 32 hours in spite of some annoying farming. The rest is fun, tough. The best being the handling of the car: all mundane actions like parking, taking stuff in the trunk, etc. become a real pleasure.

About free online games, I still play almost every day the _cinema wordle_ [Framed](https://framed.wtf/) and [_The Mini Crossword_](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini) from The New York Times.

<p style="text-align:center;color:var(--color);">❧</p>

Last year, I bought a PS5 and caught up on games of PS4 (that I never owned), based on my [_If I had a PS5 list_](https://www.senscritique.com/liste/si_j_avais_une_ps5/3843799):

- I finally finished _Horizon: Zero Dawn_ and its DLC, that I started on PC, with _PlayStation Now_, in 2020.
- The excellent _Astro's Playroom_ (free with the console). I’m looking forward to put my hands on the sequel released in 2024.
- I played _Spider-Man: Miles Morales_ to test a short episode of the series and it was a good choice, longer would have be too repetitive for me.
- The free “interactive exhibition“ _Kid A Mnesia_ is better than most exhibitions.

Also finished this year, _Sayonara Wild Hearts_ and _Cocoon_ join [my list of visually perfect games](https://www.senscritique.com/liste/visuellement_parfait/3741734). _Star Wars Jedi Survivor_ and _Chants of Sennaar_ were also great.

</div>

No clear winner for 2024 in this category for me, but a bunch of interesting trailers.

_Death Stranding 2: On the Beach_
Kojima still got it, even though the idea of a sequel to Death Stranding didn’t won me over (yet?).

_Light No Fire_
The obsessive people at _Hello Games_ reused, once again, the same trailer structure as for all _No Man’s Sky_’s trailers, for their new game. It is either sticking to one's beliefs or lacking imagination.

_Little Devil Inside_
10 years after its announcement, this charming project is still alive and delivered a long in-depth trailer, out of nowhere. What a chaotic development!

[All the trailers](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpas7-jjCh0YD6rn4gwHXXpPRxp0Q3rIP&si=4GdenZhdOCX_qcBl) for _INDIKA_ are something. Something else.

The new Naughty Dog's _Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet_
Mostly for the music of Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross. So far, I'm not a fan of the 80s aesthetic and product placement.
<a class="video-link ratio-box ratio-16-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/o7TVPoxwi74">

</a>
A side note about Reznor & Ross, they've been busy this year with the awesome _Challengers_ soundtrack and the title theme for the funny HBO _Franchise_ series. I can't wait to play a video game with music composed by these two.

Finally, special mention for the soundtrack of the French JRPG _Clair Obscur: Expedition 33_ and their hilarious [baguette trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fsMD9tPFY0).

[![Poster of Samuel TV show](/assets/2024awards/samuel.png)](/assets/2024awards/samuel.png)

</div>

- 🏆 _Samuel_
  Despite the simplicity of the black and white and the naivety of the hand drawing, the 21 short episodes of [Samuel](https://pikkukala.com/samuel/) touch directly into universal memories. This nearly one-woman show by Émilie Tronche depicts well how stupid but touching kids can be. And the perfect soundtrack finished to take me over.

- 🏆 _DJ Mehdi : Made in France_
  This documentary series in 6 episodes from Arte (so it exists in French and German), created by Thibaut de Longeville, a longtime friend of Mehdi (1977-2011), is a touching journey into the French electronic music through one of its most peculiar figure. While DJ Mehdi is not very well known, the documentary was a public success. I recommend the French podcast [_Vous avez aimé... ?_](https://shows.acast.com/vous-avez-aime/episodes/vous-avez-aime-vous-aimerez-peut-etre-7-dj-mehdi-made-in-fra) to understand why.
  It's available on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCwXWOyIR22vUL2d6XJOa7mDsBESXq5RX).

- 🥈 _Dandadan_
  Mentionned in the [Titles category](#titles), Dandadan is my favorite anime of the year. And the manga is as good. Try the first episode, every ingredients of the show is already there.

<p style="text-align:center;color:var(--color);">❧</p>

But my most wonderful TV experience of the year is with a show listed in the trailers of [my last awards](https://views.thenew.fr/posts/2023awards).
_Mrs. Davis_ is the latest series from Damon Lindelof (_Lost_, _The Leftovers_, _Watchmen_). What a show!
I was initially thrown out by the tone, expecting something more serious, but behind the comedic and expertly measured cartoonish style, I found the well written and misterious touch I was expecting from Lindelof.
At the end of each episode, I was audibly exclaiming to myself “What the fuck!”. Wihtout kidding, it's the best piece of fiction about our current AI.
