This year, I’ve been a bit overboard with 56 films.  
All those films should be released in 2021 but nothing is sure any more, so don’t trust the dates. And, of course, 14 are coming from [my expectations of last year](http://views.thenew.fr/posts/2020-films-expectations).

This year, I’m less interesting by the delta between expectations and reality and will use this list mostly to pick films from the top and just completely avoid the bottom. "Forcing" myself to watch *Bloodshot* or *Wonder Woman* last year was not fun.
