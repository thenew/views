<div class="full-width-text">

It was, again, a strange year and not the most enjoyable one, to put it nicely.  
I dived into films, partly for this blog, with my series on cinema from 1988 and my future post about blockbusters expectations versus reality.  
I finally had the chance to properly try VR with *Half-Life: Alyx* and I would like to have it at home!  
Outside of fiction, the Tokyo Olympics and Formula One gave us exciting stories.  
Otherwise, I don’t think I will remember any specific piece of art from the year but I strongly wish to experience live music again in 2022.

This year, I watched 139 (!) films, including 41 from 2021 and some from [1988](/posts/cinema-88-part-1). I’ve reached a limit, I’ll slow down for my sanity and, maybe to enjoy them even more.

🏆 *Luca* from *Pixar* is the one that gives me the most joy and tears, with a cosy Italian summer vibe. I love the character design and the music.

### Mentions

- *West Side Story* is beautiful and stimulating.
- *The Mitchells Vs. the Machines* lives up to the expectations after *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse*, the previous Sony Pictures Animation film.
- *The French Dispatch*. I was afraid of a certain _Wes Anderson fatigue_ but I loved it, even if the frame was cropped in my cinema. I need to rewatch it.
- *The Green Knight* put me in a nice _Arthurian legends_ vibe (with *Kaamelott: First Installment* as well).

🏆 Arcane is a tour de force, visually, while being a perfectly paced engaging story. I’m following _Fortiche_ productions since first [K/DA music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOxkGD8qRB4), they have stepped up in a crazy way. I don’t know how they produce a full season at this level of quality. I’m looking forward for the making-of to understand how the facial animation is done, this mix of 3D and 2D is impressive.

### Mentions

- *Ted Lasso*’s second season starts slow but becomes as good, or even better, than the amazingly bittersweet first season after a couple episodes. To be honest, it could be the best TV show of the year twice in a row.
- *The Beatles : Get Back* is a precious project in an atypical format: inspiring.
- *The Nevers* was relatively fun; don’t miss the last episode.

This is the first year that I’m really spending time watching streams on Twitch. Learning Chess, hearing the last video game news, debating politics but mostly laughing.

🏆 [Para One - SPECTRE: Shin Sekai](https://youtu.be/n-1V0zom0HU)  
Para One’s music videos of this year are hypnotic. They made me curious about his film [*Spectre: Sanity, Madness & the Family*](https://vimeo.com/610635985/4ec34cd9f7).

### Mentions

- [The Chemical Brothers - The Darkness That You Fear](https://youtu.be/b-mGA4V2LK0). The song is so catchy and the video will make you dance.

<h2 data-content='Video game'>Video game</h2>

[This year](https://www.senscritique.com/liste/jeux_termines_en_2021/29202540), I tried to complete some "old" unfinished games I had in my backlog (*Quantum Break*, *Star Wars: Battlefront II*, *Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice*, *Titanfall 2* and *Gears 5*) and frankly, I learned that you should not force yourself. I also played a lot of *For Honor* and *Star Wars: Squadrons* online, it’s still very fun! And discovered my first MMO with *Final Fantasy XIV*!

So I don’t have a clear winner of the best video game of 2021 but I spent many hours on two AAA games that don’t reinvent the wheel but are really nice to play: *Halo Infinite* multiplayer and *Humankind*.

On the indie side, *The Artful Escape* and *Unpacking* were very good surprises (contrary to *Twelve minutes*).  
I also discovered very late in the year [*Wordle*](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle) and I’m already addicted.
