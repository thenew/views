Already my fifth post listing films from 1988, after [the](/posts/cinema-88-part-1) [first](/posts/cinema-88-part-2) [four](/posts/cinema-88-disney-plus-edition) [posts](/posts/cinema-88-part-4), I'm almost done with the "obvious" names.

Perhaps the biggest title missing from my 1988 film collection.
Stephen Frears is a big name and still makes films these days, but the only one of his films that interested me and that I watched was the likeable _High Fidelity_.
Funny that it reminded me of _Cruel Intentions_ (1999), but I discovered that it’s adapted from the same 1782 French novel _Les Liaisons dangereuses_.

With the historical setting and the AAA cast, I always thought it was a serious movie, what a surprise!
I would have like to have more comic gestures, but the balance between humour and play style is quite good.

Not a fan of Glenn Close, but John Malkovich is hilarious popping in and out of frame in the background.

Michelle Pfeiffer is on point but it’s hard to get attached to her character. And the young Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves are delightful.

Finally a bit I was a little disappointed, as I was expecting a more epic historical film, but now I'll know what it's about the next time there's a reference to it.

<h2 data-content='Hairspray'>Hairspray</h2>

[![screenshot of Hairspray](/assets/88_5/1988_Hairspray.jpg)](/assets/88_5/1988_Hairspray.jpg)

I'd never heard of this film before, but it's a classic for some people and had a remake in 2007.

My reaction after discovering it was mostly confusion. It’s campy, but not enough to be fun.
There is no challenge, no story. Everything happen easily. Only segregation is addressed, but not dealt with. It’s definitively uplifting, but every character is crazy, it’s frightening. The same situations are repeated over and over again, I’m baffled and bored at the same time.

I will only remember Penny, the silly and awkward character with pigtails, always sucking her gum ball.

<h2 class="with-credits" data-content='Scrooged'>Scrooged</h2>
<div class="credits">directed by Richard Donner</div>

In between two _Lethal Weapon_, Donner made another Christmas film. The same year that Elfman did _Midnight Run (link)_ and _Beetlejuice_, he also composed for _Scrooged_, which is why the intro sounds so much like a Burton film.

So the cast looked promising, but the whole thing hasn’t aged well:
The love interest is still fully in love with a rich asshole, even after 15 years! But everyone else is also ready to applause a mogul if he says “sorry, I've changed”. And the closing speech, as American Christmasy as it gets, casually slips in a sexual assault. It was definitely another time.

What hasn’t aged are the practical effects. The film looks good and is not short on fantasy.

I didn’t really take anything from the film, except that it’s a Bill Murray show.

Fun fact, he took a 4 years break, after Ghostbusters (1984), to study philosophy in France and came back to acting with this film.

In my mind, its persona is not yet definitive. Like in the two _Ghostbusters_, he is too weird, with a lot of wrongly timed gags. I think his style became more interesting from _Groundhog Day_ onwards.

<h2 class="with-credits" data-content='Frantic'>Frantic</h2>
<div class="credits">directed by Roman Coppola</div>

<div class="full-width tiles">

From the infamous Roman Coppola. I've only seen _Ghostwriter_ by him. _Frantic_ is very similar but less well done and exciting. Instead of Ewan McGregor, we have Harrison Ford, not a bad substitute. (The same year, he also starred in the lovely [_Working Girl_](<(/posts/cinema-88-part-1)>))

I loved the setting: telling the story of an American in Paris brings a delightful mix of French and English and makes a good portrait of Paris in the 80s.
It's fun to find some famous actors like Dominique Pinon in supporting roles.

There are some really nice shots: when he wakes up in the barge or looks at himself in the mirror at the airport.

Harrison Ford is just pretty, Ennio Morricone does some nice pieces with the obligatory accordion and Emmanuel Segnier is okay, even if her character is a bit too cliché.

But the film has too many slapstick cartoonish stunts and cringy dances (it reminds me _Scarface_). Like in _Blade Runner_, Ford is too goofy. What is it with 80s films?

In short, _Frantic_ is correct but not memorable. A bit too long, with too many back and forth, like with the suitcase, but that's part of the genre, right?

<h2 class="with-credits" data-content='The Last Temptation of Christ'>The Last Temptation of Christ</h2>

So, one of the living legends of American cinema did actually make a film in 1988. But apparently, not his most remarquable one.

I still remember discovering Scorsese with _Casino_ in a public Library, being amazed despite the uncomfortable plastic chair.
While I later studied _Mean Streets_ (1973) in school, and liked most of his films, the lastest example _Killers of the Flower Moon_ (2023!), I still can't wrap my head around his cinema, there is something that doesn't click with me.

So I came to _The Last Temptation of Christ_ with little to big expectations and came back as confused as before.

A blond, Willem Dafoe, Jesus is hanging with john, baptist and peers in Nazareth. All women are called Mary. With Harvey Keitel as Judas and David Bowie as Pilate, the whole thing looks ridiculously fake, or American, I'm not sure.

It's a good catechism lesson, it's funny that I didn't remember learning about the resurrection of Lazarus. I knew about water into wine, the multiplication of loaves or walking on water but I didn't learn the most incredible miracle of all.

It's crazy that there was controversy when it came out when it's the bible by the book. I certainly lacked a (American?) Christian sensitivity to understand the point of this project.

A mention to the music by Peter gabriel, which is also marked by its times but has not aged like the rest.

The end reminds me of _The Green Knight_, I love when cinema plays with timeline to show temptation.
The very last shot also piqued my curiosity: Scorsese ends with a strange and beautiful camera roll effect, as if to reveal the fiction of the film, but also of the whole story?

All in all, it's a weird experience from which I didn't take much away.

Some says it's the best Dutch movie of all time.
Funny thing, at the time of publishing this article, the film is re-released in cinemas in France and Netherlands.

But I discovered it during the [Imagine](https://www.imaginefilmfestival.nl/film/spoorloos/) film festival in Amsterdam. With an interesting introduction talking about the alchemist subtext interpretation.

The film is always advertised by quoting Kubrick saying it was the most terrifying film he’d ever seen.

More French speaking than Dutch, but the actors are good, it's a real pleasure to have a multilingual film with no acting issue, wondering how the director controlled this.

Nice looking film, so good shots. Nice restauration coordinated by the [Eye Filmmuseum](https://player.eyefilm.nl/nl/films/spoorloos)

A third act like _Old Boy_. Very surprising and peculiar film but it would be wrong to overrate it.

George Sluizer directed his own Hollywood remake 5 years later, with a fancy casting. But it looks like a big miss according to the reception.

Before wrapping up this already too long post, the Eye cinema screened a film I never head of before my research, but it was on my 1988 watch list, so I couldn't miss it.

I was a nice surprise to have the Dutch cinematographer be there for a short talk before the film. [Theo van de Sande](http://theovandesande.com/) has a long and still running career (Blade, Cruel intentions, Volcano).

He also did _CROSSING DELANCEY_ released in 1988, should I catch it up?

The film has a cult following as a hidden gem with a strong twist.

Once again, we have a big name at the soundtrack: Tangerine Dream. Not their best work, though.

you feel the small budget

Anthony Edwards is convicing but Mare Winningham's haircut is a distraction, to say the least, with today's eyes.

It's a romance movie, at its core, but I didn't fully buy their love.

I was pleasently surprised
interesting surealist slow twist, it develops an unsetting atmosphere really well.

Even if I didn't guessed the end correctly, I’m still not totally onboarded with the result.
