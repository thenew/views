The more I look for films released in 1988 and the more I found new ones, so after the [first](/posts/cinema-88-part-1) [three](/posts/cinema-88-part-2) [parts](/posts/cinema-88-disney-plus-edition), this fourth list is far from the last.

Perhaps the biggest title missing from my 1988 film collection.
Stephen Frears is a big name and still makes films these days, but the only one of his films that interested me and that I watched was the likeable _High Fidelity_.
Funny that it reminded me of _Cruel Intentions_ (1999), but I discovered that it’s adapted from the same 1782 French novel _Les Liaisons dangereuses_.

With the historical setting and the AAA cast, I always thought it was a serious movie, what a surprise!
I would have like to have more comic gestures, but the balance between humour and play style is quite good.

Not a fan of Glenn Close, but John Malkovich is hilarious popping in and out of frame in the background.

Michelle Pfeiffer is on point but it’s hard to get attached to her character. And the young Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves are delightful.

Finally a bit I was a little disappointed, as I was expecting a more epic historical film, but now I'll know what it's about the next time there's a reference to it.

<h2 data-content='Hairspray'>Hairspray</h2>

I'd never heard of this film before, but it's a classic for some people and had a remake in 2007.

My reaction after discovering it was mostly confusion. It’s campy, but not enough to be fun.
There is no challenge, no story. Everything happen easily. Only segregation is addressed, but not dealt with. It’s definitively uplifting, but every character is crazy, it’s frightening. The same characters and scenes are repeated over and over again, I’m baffled and bored at the same time.

I will only remember Penny, the silly and awkward character with pigtails, always sucking her gum ball.

<h2 class="with-credits" data-content='Scrooged'>Scrooged</h2>
<div class="credits">directed by Richard Donner</div>

In between two _Lethal Weapon_, Donner made another Christmas film. The same year that Elfman did _Midnight Run (link)_ and _Beetlejuice_, he also composed for _Scrooged_, which is why the intro sounds so much like a Burton film.

So the cast looked promising, but the whole thing hasn’t aged well:
The love interest is still fully in love with a rich asshole, even after 15 years! But everyone else is also ready to applause a mogul if he says “sorry, I've changed”. And the closing speech, as American Christmasy as it gets, casually slips in a sexual assault. It was definitely another time.

What hasn’t aged are the practical effects. The film looks good and is not short on fantasy.

I didn’t really take anything from the film, except that it’s a Bill Murray show.

Fun fact, he took a 4 years break, after Ghostbusters (1984), to study philosophy in France and came back to acting with this film.

In my mind, its persona is not yet definitive. Like in the two _Ghostbusters_, he is too weird, with a lot of wrongly timed gags. I think his style became more interesting from _Groundhog Day_ onwards*.*
