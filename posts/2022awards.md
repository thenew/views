This year, I tried paragliding for the first time, moved after five years, paddleboarded in Amsterdam's canals, travelled to seven countries, and even went to a techno day festival without drugs or alcohol - all unexpected experiences! That might just be my excuse to publish a year-roundup in February.

For the first time in my annual awards, I want to give a shout-out to manga. I've been a fan since I was a kid, but over the years we've grown apart. To avoid buying hundreds of volumes, I purchased a refurbished iPad Mini 4 (2015). Even though the system is slow, it's been great catching up on comics.

I binged read all 🏆 *Blue Lock* during the World Cup. I’m not fan of most of the characters but the shonen recipe works so well. Even when playing football, I was trying to trigger my powers.

I finally read the phenomenon *Demon Slayer* and it’s not original but a perfect embodiment of shonen.

Navigating the legal comic app world can be tricky, but I read the nice recent *Moon Deer* and discovered the crazy *MetaBaron* series.

I’m also surprised by the amount of TV shows I followed this year (and a lot of good ones!). And I’m less bothered to stop before the end if I don’t like it. 

🏆 Parlement season 2 keeps up the feat of making the european parliament fun. I love to hear French, Italian, German and other languages in the same show. I felt even more in love with the characters.

Animated series were so great this year: *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners*, *Genndy Tartakovsky’s Primal* and *Lastman* season 2

A lot of good quirky comedies I recommend:
- *Our Flag Means Death* is the best thing Taika Waititi did in 2022,
- *The AfterParty* from my favourite Christopher Miller (LEGO, Jump Street, Into the Spider-Verse),
- *Loot* with Maya Rudolph,
- *Avenue 5* season 2 (I still can’t believe we had a second season),
- *Peacemaker* from a surprisingly inspired James Gunn,
- and even *The Pentaverate*, with the return of Mike Myers at his best.

2022 was the downfall of Disney (Marvel/Star Wars) TV productions:
it has been a serie of facepalms: *Moon Knight*, *Obi-Wan Kenobi*, *The Book of Boba Fett* and the frackring joke of *Zen - Grogu and Dust Bunnies* by Ghibli.  
Thankfully, *Andor* is technically well-done and has good ideas, but it's too long to get started and is too inconsistent.

. Startup docu drama:
- Dropout
- SuperPumped

*L'Imperatrice* was the first real concert after the pandemic, and the audience was on fire. I highly recommend checking out this French pop-disco band live.

For logistical reasons, I saw *Phoenix* twice and *Metronomy* three times this year. I love both of these bands, so I always had a great time.

I really enjoyed *Beach House* at Best Kept Secret festival, and seeing *The Strokes* for the first time live was something. Sadly, it was a bit spoiled by the attitude of their frontman.

A big frustration was to not being able to see Leonie Pernet live. She was my discovery of the year, and her music accompanied me on my trips. But there is a nice live session from [france.tv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99Wr8WCsQYk).

Every time I’ve shown the trailer to people, they’ve gone from doubtful to curious about this weird project.

- [Spider-Man: Across the SpiderVerse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqGjhVJWtEg)

I adored the first one, so I'm already sold on this one. However, I'm amazed to see they used a mother's speech in the trailer.

I aimed to watch fewer movies in 2023 than in the previous year (139!), so I ended up watching only 76 films, but, surprisingly, including 40 released this year.

Gasper Noé came to Amsterdam to present *Vortex*, his film is very moving and I enjoyed the Q&A session as he is very chatty.

*The Batman*, *The Bad Guys* and *Nope* have great, thrilling moments.

*Coupez!* (*Final Cut*) is a clever and delightful meta-film from Michel Hazanavicius. Seems like it's the season for films exploring the medium with *Babylon* and *The Fabelmans*.

*Everything everywhere all at once* was a lot of fun and I’m glad to see it getting a lot of praise, but I still found it too long.

The two big shocks of my film year were, once again, animated movies (or almost).

*Le Sommet des Dieux* is a perfect adaptation of the manga (I’m reading it and the film is way less slow and depressing). It’s exhilarating and intense.

Much to my surprise, 🏆 *Avatar: The Way of Water* has been my favourite screening of the year. In 3D, HFR, it’s a technological, gripping, tour de force, as well as a really fun adventure that takes you to another world. I was flabbergasted seeing the, unfortunately too few, gorgeous spaceship scenes, I would love full films set in space, without actors.

2022 was a very tough year for digital services I use daily and more widely the press, I wanted to mention them:  
We said goodbye to *Gamekult*, the last good French video game news website, and more globally to video game journalism which has never been worse (Nibel, *IGN, Giant Bomb,* *GameSpot*, etc.)  
We said goodbye to [*Tracks*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310534/), Germano-French TV magazine about underground cultures, unceremoniously killed by *Arte* after 25 years.  
We said goodbye to *Figma*, the great product fighting against Adobe, now bought by Adobe.  
We said goodbye to *Twitter*, acquired by a mogul.
