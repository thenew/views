description: All manga, films, music, TV and games I liked in 2022. It took me two months to write this review of last year, so it should worth it.

This year, I tried paragliding for the first time, moved after five years, paddleboarded in Amsterdam's canals, travelled to seven countries, and even went to a techno day festival without drugs or alcohol - all unexpected experiences! That might just be my excuse to publish a year roundup in February.

For the first time in my annual awards, I want to give a shout-out to manga. I've been a fan since I was a kid, but over the years we've grown apart. To avoid buying hundreds of volumes, I purchased a refurbished iPad Mini 4 (2015). Even though the system is slow, it's been great catching up on comics.

I binged read all 🏆 *Blue Lock* during the World Cup. I already forgot most of the characters but the shonen recipe works so well. Even when playing football in real life, I was scanning the field like in the manga.

I finally read the phenomenon *Demon Slayer*, it’s not original but a perfect embodiment of shonen. I’m still amazed that the author decided to not continue it despite the world sensation. 

Navigating the legal comic app world can be tricky, but I read the nice recent *Moon Deer* and discovered the crazy *MetaBaron* series.

<h2 data-content='TV'>TV</h2>

I’m surprised by the number of TV shows I followed this year (and a lot of good ones!) Maybe because I’m less bothered to stop before the end if I don’t like it. 

🏆 Parlement season 2 keeps up the feat of making the European parliament fun. I love to hear French, Italian, German and other languages in the same show. I felt even more in love with the characters.

### Animation

Animated series were so great this year: *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners*, *Genndy Tartakovsky’s Primal* and *Lastman* season 2

### So many good quirky comedies

- *Our Flag Means Death* is the best thing Taika Waititi did in 2022,
- *The AfterParty* from my favourite Christopher Miller (LEGO, Jump Street, Into the Spider-Verse),
- *Loot* with Maya Rudolph,
- *Avenue 5* season 2 (how did we get a second season?),
- *Peacemaker* from a surprisingly inspired James Gunn,
- And even *The Pentaverate*, with the return of Mike Myers at his best.

### The downfall of Disney

2022 was a series fo facepalms for Disney (Marvel/Star Wars) TV productions: *Moon Knight*, *Obi-Wan Kenobi*, *The Book of Boba Fett* and the fracking joke of *Zen - Grogu and Dust Bunnies* by Ghibli.  
Thankfully, *Andor* is technically well done and has good ideas, but it's too long to get started and is too inconsistent.

### Silicon Valley startups docudrama

I have a perverse liking for dark comedies based on real life companies. It’s always baffling and infuriating. As the false hope of techno-solutionism fades, there are increasingly more series about it.  
This year, I enjoyed *The Dropout*, about Theranos, and *SuperPumped*, about Uber.  
I'm watching *We Crashed* and *Billion dollar code* so I will write something about this type of fiction maybe one day.

</div>

*L'Imperatrice* was the first real concert after the pandemic, and the audience was on fire. I highly recommend checking out this French pop-disco band live.

For logistical reasons, I saw *Phoenix* twice and *Metronomy* three times this year. I love both of these bands, so I had a blast every time.  
I would recommend their music videos too. I particularly liked *Phoenix*’s videos for their latest album and how they use them in their live shows. Check out [Alpha Zulu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqN9flclRio), [After Midnight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVsgdURODeg) and [Tonight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxTCTAnTP6Q)!

I really enjoyed *Beach House* at Best Kept Secret festival, and seeing *The Strokes* for the first time live was something. Sadly, it was a bit spoiled by the attitude of their frontman.

A big frustration was to not being able to see Leonie Pernet live. She was my discovery of the year, and her music accompanied me on my trips. But there is a nice live session from [france.tv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99Wr8WCsQYk).

<h2 data-content='Trailers'>Trailers</h2>

- *Fresh* Trailer  
This trailer does a good job keeping the twist a mystery while showcasing a great cast, good music, and a nice visual identity. And The film lives up to its promise.

- *Barbie* Teaser  
Every time I’ve shown the trailer to people, they’ve gone from doubtful to curious about this weird project.

- *Spider-Man: Across the SpiderVerse* Trailer  
I adored the first one, so I'm already sold on this one. However, I'm amazed to see they used a mother's speech in the trailer.

- *Death Stranding 2 (Working Title)* TGA 2022 Teaser Trailer - made by *you-know-who*  
It’s more of the same and less surprising than most of his trailers, but I’ll take it any day.

I aimed to watch fewer movies in 2023 than in the previous year (139!), so I ended up watching only 76 films, but, surprisingly, including 40 released this year.  

### Mentions

- Gasper Noé came to Amsterdam to present *Vortex*, his film is very moving and I enjoyed the Q&A session as he is very chatty.  
- *The Batman*, *The Bad Guys* and *Nope* have great, thrilling moments.  
- *Coupez!* (*Final Cut*) is a clever and delightful meta-film from Michel Hazanavicius. Seems like it's the season for films exploring the medium with *Babylon* and *The Fabelmans*.  
- *Everything everywhere all at once* was a lot of fun and I’m glad to see it getting a lot of praise, but I still found it too long.

### Shocks
The two big shocks of my year were, once again, animated films (or almost).

*Le Sommet des Dieux* is a perfect adaptation of the manga (I’m reading it and the film is way less slow and depressing). It’s exhilarating and intense.

Much to my surprise, 🏆 *Avatar: The Way of Water* has been my favourite screening of the year.  
In 3D, HFR, it’s a technological, gripping, tour de force, as well as a really fun adventure that takes you to another world. I was flabbergasted seeing the, unfortunately too few, gorgeous spaceship scenes, I would love full films set in space, without actors.

Even more interesting films in the rest of [my top on SensCritique](https://www.senscritique.com/top/les_meilleurs_films_de_2022/3189085?page=1).


<h2 data-content='Video Game'>Video Game</h2>

Although the *Wordle* craze has died down, I still play its cinematic version nearly every day: [Framed](https://framed.wtf/). About *Wordle*, I recommend a really nice interview of its creator in [My Perfect Console](https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/josh-wardle-creator-of-wordle).
  
I’m still not playing many games on their initial release, because of time and money.
Instead, I played two great games, from a few years ago, *Control* and *Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order* (*Obi-Wan* poorly copied a lot from it).

But to reward games released or updated in 2022, this is my personal *weird* top:

- 🏆 *Marvel Snap*
- *Splatoon 3*
- *Halo Infinite* & *For Honor*
- *Sifu*
- *Destiny 2*

<h2 data-content='In Memoriam'>In Memoriam</h2>

2022 was a very tough year for digital services I use daily and more widely the press, I wanted to mention them:  
We said goodbye to *Gamekult*, the last good French video game news website, and more globally to video game journalism which has never been worse (Nibel, *IGN, Giant Bomb,* *GameSpot*, etc.)  
We said goodbye to [*Tracks*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310534/), Germano-French TV magazine about underground cultures, unceremoniously killed by *Arte* after 25 years.  
We said goodbye to *Figma*, the great product fighting against Adobe, now bought by Adobe.  
We said goodbye to *Twitter*, acquired by a mogul.
