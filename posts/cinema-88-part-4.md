After the [first list of films](/posts/cinema-88-part-1) from 1988, my hunt is continuing. Difficult to find old movies on the "mainstreaming" platforms so I’ve started looking into Plex, which has, surprisingly, free films to stream with ads. Terrible ads, by the way. So this second part is a mixed bag of hand picked and random movies.
