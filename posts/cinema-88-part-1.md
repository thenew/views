1988 was the first steps of the World Wide Web, the World Expo in Brisbane, only time The Netherlands has been champion male football (UEFA Euro 88 in Germany), president François Mitterrand is reelected in France but I'm also born. So, for no more reason, I decided last year to watch as many films from 88 as possible.

Let’s start with

Bruce willis was the action hero of my childhood with The Fifth Element. He was like Son Goku: he saves the day without coming out unscathed.

I saw the film a long time ago and thought I remembered it well but after watching it again, I only had in mind the more than iconic moments, and they are plenty: the fire hose, the ventilation ducts, the duct tape in the back, Hans’ fall, etc. 

But the film is so generous, it’s a non-stop ride. The intricate villain’s plan is slowly unfolding while actions sequences go on. John McClain is smart but not smarter than the bad guys. The German gymnasts are hilarious, Alan Rickman's performance is insane. 

The cinematography starts in warm Los Angeles sunshine before quickly dives into dark night and high lights.

I totally forgot that the Christmas music is used all along the movie, it’s fun and great.

The exposition is smart: the first dialogue in the plane introduces the protagonist and is the cause of him being bare feet during the rest of his suffering. The touchscreen at the entrance of the building is a proof of its high technology but also shows to John that his wife changed name. Examples are numerous.

The directing is only at its best in motion.

I’m sure that, as a kid, I loved the mocking tone. The film is sparing no one: the greedy journalists, the frat boys FBI agents Johnson and Johnson (haha), the imbecile chief of police, the businessman full of coke.

It's still one of the best animated film of all time. I love other works from Otomo in animation or manga. It's a cornerstone of the animation history and a huge influence in cyberpunk aesthetic. You should watch and rewatch it, no doubt.

So badass and stupid in the same time, really punk. I didn't expect the groomy beginning

Little happy story hiding a bit more.
Smart to show on Katharine, the boss, knows the tricks, even if younger, to stay at this position of power.
Very good last scene showing how ecstatic Tess is by her new position, but the back travelling is revealing a different view: she is just another small gear in the machine. 
This last shot leaving the city reflects the opposite nice first shot.
Harisson Ford, Sigourney Waver, Kevin Spacey plays an asshole, cocainoman 

Ha but it's Mike Nichols from the graduate! okay, the guy has some darkness.

<h2 class="with-credits" data-content='Police Story'>Police Story</h2>
<div class="credits"><em>Ging chaat goo si</em> with Jackie Chan</div>

[![screenshot of Police Story](/assets/88_1/police-story.jpg)](/assets/88_1/police-story.jpg.jpg)

Released in 1985 in Hong Kong, but in 1987 in France and 1988 in USA.

Wow! I love Jacky Chan and I was a big fan as a kid but I wasn’t aware of this saga until late. I finally catch up and, clearly, I’m not used (yet) to the HK cinema. It’s almost just a suite of stunt scenes but the other scenes are surprisingly telling a coherent story. It’s simple and goofy but you can feel the rage. The sequel has been originally released in 1988 so I’m looking forward to include it in my next list.


<h2 class="with-credits" data-content='Tucker, the man and his dream'>Tucker, the man and his dream</h2>
<div class="credits">by Francis Ford Coppola <span class="network">- Netflix</span></div>

First time watching a Coppola's film after *Apocalypse Now*. I didn't expect this over-the-top,  joyful, car ride. I liked the too big for life character. Always smiling but also too aggressive with his team.

<h2 class="with-credits" data-content='The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!'>The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!</h2>
<div class="credits">by David Zucker</div>

Not the best from the series but still love it, way too salacious. 
Some lines are still great ("A parachute not opening…that's a way to die." :D)

<h2 class="with-credits" data-content='The Bear'>The Bear</h2>
<div class="credits"><em>L’Ours</em> by Jean Jacques Annaud</div>

Except some trippy nightmare scenes that don’t fit with the rest of the film, I enjoyed a lot the cinematography and the journey. The animals are very beautifully filmed. The story is more engaging than I expected. Peculiar shots (close-ups, first person, distorted) are cleverly flavouring the direction.

À part des scènes de cauchemars hors ton, superbes cadres et photographie. Les animaux sont très très bien filmés et l'histoire est mieux rythmé que je l'aurais imaginé. Des plans chelous vient casser la mise en scène, gros plans, premier personne, déformé avec un bon équilibre.

<h2 class="with-credits" data-content='Dead Ringers'>Dead Ringers</h2>
<div class="credits">by David Cronenberg</div>

So weird. Adapted from a true story, which makes it even more weird. It's touching many topics, from science, gynecology, fecondity, drugs, identity, links. It's convincing, good performance from Irons but I don't grasp the story.

Nice decorum, this late 80's black marble and red chirurgical tunic are amazing.

Pretty subtle for a Cronenberg after all.

Seeing again a lonely crazy Iron eating birthday cake after the Watchmen TV show was a pleasure.

<h2 class="with-credits" data-content='Mississippi Burning'>Mississippi Burning</h2>
<div class="credits">by Alan Parker</div>

Willem Dafoe is so young, he looks almost trustable.

Too bad, the black character with the most lines is a boucanier from the cop but it's a really good scene.

The film takes the time to show that the lawless actions at the end are understandable.

The interviews of the locals are chilling and all the KKK 's arguments are still in the air today. It's revolting.

Some nice dynamic shots. Reminds me of Spielberg. Lots of extras. Army of feds.

Mc Dormand plays a brave, cute and smart character. Jackman is a player, real fun, playing dumber than he is.
