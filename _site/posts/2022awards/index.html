<div class="post">
  <p>This year, I tried paragliding for the first time, moved after five years, paddleboarded in Amsterdam's canals, travelled to seven countries, and even went to a techno day festival without drugs or alcohol - all unexpected experiences! That might just be my excuse to publish a year roundup in February.</p>
<h2 data-content='Manga'>Manga</h2>
<div class="full-width">

</div>
<p>For the first time in my annual awards, I want to give a shout-out to manga. I've been a fan since I was a kid, but over the years we've grown apart. To avoid buying hundreds of volumes, I purchased a refurbished iPad Mini 4 (2015). Even though the system is slow, it's been great catching up on comics.</p>
<p>I binged read all 🏆 <em>Blue Lock</em> during the World Cup. I already forgot most of the characters but the shonen recipe works so well. Even when playing football in real life, I was scanning the field like in the manga.</p>
<p>I finally read the phenomenon <em>Demon Slayer</em>, it’s not original but a perfect embodiment of shonen. I’m still amazed that the author decided to not continue it despite the world sensation.</p>
<p>Navigating the legal comic app world can be tricky, but I read the nice recent <em>Moon Deer</em> and discovered the crazy <em>MetaBaron</em> series.</p>
<h2 data-content='TV'>TV</h2>
<p>I’m surprised by the number of TV shows I followed this year (and a lot of good ones!) Maybe because I’m less bothered to stop before the end if I don’t like it.</p>
<p>🏆 Parlement season 2 keeps up the feat of making the European parliament fun. I love to hear French, Italian, German and other languages in the same show. I felt even more in love with the characters.</p>
<h3>Animation</h3>
<p>Animated series were so great this year: <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em>, <em>Genndy Tartakovsky’s Primal</em> and <em>Lastman</em> season 2</p>
<h3>So many good quirky comedies</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Our Flag Means Death</em> is the best thing Taika Waititi did in 2022,</li>
<li><em>The AfterParty</em> from my favourite Christopher Miller (LEGO, Jump Street, Into the Spider-Verse),</li>
<li><em>Loot</em> with Maya Rudolph,</li>
<li><em>Avenue 5</em> season 2 (how did we get a second season?),</li>
<li><em>Peacemaker</em> from a surprisingly inspired James Gunn,</li>
<li>And even <em>The Pentaverate</em>, with the return of Mike Myers at his best.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The downfall of Disney</h3>
<p>2022 was a series fo facepalms for Disney (Marvel/Star Wars) TV productions: <em>Moon Knight</em>, <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em>, <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> and the fracking joke of <em>Zen - Grogu and Dust Bunnies</em> by Ghibli.<br>
Thankfully, <em>Andor</em> is technically well done and has good ideas, but it's too long to get started and is too inconsistent.</p>
<h3>Silicon Valley startups docudrama</h3>
<p>I have a perverse liking for dark comedies based on real life companies. It’s always baffling and infuriating. As the false hope of techno-solutionism fades, there are increasingly more series about it.<br>
This year, I enjoyed <em>The Dropout</em>, about Theranos, and <em>SuperPumped</em>, about Uber.<br>
I'm watching <em>We Crashed</em> and <em>Billion dollar code</em> so I will write something about this type of fiction maybe one day.</p>

<h2 data-content='Music'>Music</h2>
<div class="full-width">
<p><img src="/assets/2022awards/2022music.jpg" alt="Music"></p>
</div>
<p><em>L'Imperatrice</em> was the first real concert after the pandemic, and the audience was on fire. I highly recommend checking out this French pop-disco band live.</p>
<p>For logistical reasons, I saw <em>Phoenix</em> twice and <em>Metronomy</em> three times this year. I love both of these bands, so I had a blast every time.<br>
I would recommend their music videos too. I particularly liked <em>Phoenix</em>’s videos for their latest album and how they use them in their live shows. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqN9flclRio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha Zulu</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVsgdURODeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">After Midnight</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxTCTAnTP6Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tonight</a>!</p>
<p>I really enjoyed <em>Beach House</em> at Best Kept Secret festival, and seeing <em>The Strokes</em> for the first time live was something. Sadly, it was a bit spoiled by the attitude of their frontman.</p>
<p>A big frustration was to not being able to see Leonie Pernet live. She was my discovery of the year, and her music accompanied me on my trips. But there is a nice live session from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99Wr8WCsQYk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">france.tv</a>.</p>
<h2 data-content='Trailers'>Trailers</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Fresh</em> Trailer<br>
This trailer does a good job keeping the twist a mystery while showcasing a great cast, good music, and a nice visual identity. And The film lives up to its promise.</li>
</ul>
<a class="video-link ratio-box ratio-16-3" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUT4YskFTig">
  <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/iUT4YskFTig/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="">
</a>
<ul>
<li><em>Barbie</em> Teaser<br>
Every time I’ve shown the trailer to people, they’ve gone from doubtful to curious about this weird project.</li>
</ul>
<a class="video-link ratio-box ratio-16-3" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWMAVkiz_gk">
  <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/XWMAVkiz_gk/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="">
</a>
<ul>
<li><em>Spider-Man: Across the SpiderVerse</em> Trailer<br>
I adored the first one, so I'm already sold on this one. However, I'm amazed to see they used a mother's speech in the trailer.</li>
</ul>

</a>
<ul>
<li><em>Death Stranding 2 (Working Title)</em> TGA 2022 Teaser Trailer - made by <em>you-know-who</em><br>
It’s more of the same and less surprising than most of his trailers, but I’ll take it any day.</li>
</ul>

<div class="full-width">
<p><img src="/assets/2022awards/2022films.jpg" alt="Films"></p>
</div>
<p>I aimed to watch fewer movies in 2023 than in the previous year (139!), so I ended up watching only 76 films, but, surprisingly, including 40 released this year.</p>
<h3>Mentions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gasper Noé came to Amsterdam to present <em>Vortex</em>, his film is very moving and I enjoyed the Q&amp;A session as he is very chatty.</li>
<li><em>The Batman</em>, <em>The Bad Guys</em> and <em>Nope</em> have great, thrilling moments.</li>
<li><em>Coupez!</em> (<em>Final Cut</em>) is a clever and delightful meta-film from Michel Hazanavicius. Seems like it's the season for films exploring the medium with <em>Babylon</em> and <em>The Fabelmans</em>.</li>
<li><em>Everything everywhere all at once</em> was a lot of fun and I’m glad to see it getting a lot of praise, but I still found it too long.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Shocks</h3>
<p>The two big shocks of my year were, once again, animated films (or almost).</p>
<p><em>Le Sommet des Dieux</em> is a perfect adaptation of the manga (I’m reading it and the film is way less slow and depressing). It’s exhilarating and intense.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, 🏆 <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> has been my favourite screening of the year.<br>
In 3D, HFR, it’s a technological, gripping, tour de force, as well as a really fun adventure that takes you to another world. I was flabbergasted seeing the, unfortunately too few, gorgeous spaceship scenes, I would love full films set in space, without actors.</p>
<p>Even more interesting films in the rest of <a href="https://www.senscritique.com/top/les_meilleurs_films_de_2022/3189085?page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my top on SensCritique</a>.</p>
<h2 data-content='Video Game'>Video Game</h2>
<p>Although the <em>Wordle</em> craze has died down, I still play its cinematic version nearly every day: <a href="https://framed.wtf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Framed</a>. About <em>Wordle</em>, I recommend a really nice interview of its creator in <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/josh-wardle-creator-of-wordle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Perfect Console</a>.</p>
<p>I’m still not playing many games on their initial release, because of time and money.<br>
Instead, I played two great games, from a few years ago, <em>Control</em> and <em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</em> (<em>Obi-Wan</em> poorly copied a lot from it).</p>
<p>But to reward games released or updated in 2022, this is my personal <em>weird</em> top:</p>
<ul>
<li>🏆 <em>Marvel Snap</em></li>
<li><em>Splatoon 3</em></li>
<li><em>Halo Infinite</em> &amp; <em>For Honor</em></li>
<li><em>Sifu</em></li>
<li><em>Destiny 2</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 data-content='In Memoriam'>In Memoriam</h2>
<p>2022 was a very tough year for digital services I use daily and more widely the press, I wanted to mention them:<br>
We said goodbye to <em>Gamekult</em>, the last good French video game news website, and more globally to video game journalism which has never been worse (Nibel, <em>IGN, Giant Bomb,</em> <em>GameSpot</em>, etc.)<br>
We said goodbye to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310534/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Tracks</em></a>, Germano-French TV magazine about underground cultures, unceremoniously killed by <em>Arte</em> after 25 years.<br>
We said goodbye to <em>Figma</em>, the great product fighting against Adobe, now bought by Adobe.<br>
We said goodbye to <em>Twitter</em>, acquired by a mogul.</p>
