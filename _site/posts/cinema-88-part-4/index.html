<p>The more I look for films released in 1988 and the more I found new ones, so after the <a href="/posts/cinema-88-part-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first</a> <a href="/posts/cinema-88-part-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three</a> <a href="/posts/cinema-88-disney-plus-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parts</a>, this fourth list is far from the last.</p>
<p>Thankfully, once again, I had good (and bad) surprises discovering some films from 88. This time, they all have, at least, one star in the casting.<br>
I’m still watching them on streaming services and French TVs, but I’ll soon have to find other ways.</p>

<p>JCVD is really strong in this one, even if the martial quality of the film is poor and the story is thin. But I enjoyed some sceneries, like the intro showing the arena. The French dubbed version is as bad as you can imagine from 1988.<br>
I was surprised to learn, at the end, that the film is based on the true story of Frank Dux. It kind of changed my whole perspective.<br>
It’s been some months since I saw <em>Bloodsport</em> and I can no longer tell it apart from another Jean-Claude Van Damme flick from one year later: <em>Kickboxer</em>.</p>

<p>I heard this title a lot, but I think I never saw it before. No hot take here, it’s a solid funny movie.<br>
I love the opening presenting every character and the actor playing it. Every film should do it.<br>
And the actors are great: John Cleese is like expected. Kevin Kline is an actor I never noticed before, his character is so hectic, and I loved his improbable look.<br>
I like Jamie Lee Curtis since <em>True Lies</em>, and she is shinning in this role, she is funny and sexy. For once, the sex jokes are good, like the one with foreign languages.<br>
Some good jokes, a good time.</p>
<h2 class="with-credits" data-content='Midnight Run'>Midnight Run</h2>
<div class="credits">directed by Martin Brest</div>
<p><a href="/assets/88_4/midnight-run.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="/assets/88_4/midnight-run.png" alt="screenshot of Midnight Run"></a></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.arte.tv/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARTE</a>, I could catch up on this action comedy that didn’t leave a big mark. Its director Martin Brest has a bumpy career.<br>
<em>Midnight Run</em> doesn’t reinvent the wheel, it’s the typical &quot;American betrayed bounty hunter road trip buddy movie&quot;.<br>
It reminds me of <em>The Gauntlet</em>, but I’m sure it’s a cliché story. I still like the good twists.<br>
Action is a bit too comical for my taste, especially because of the music, but the film is charming. De Niro is doing De Niro.<br>
Mildly interesting fact, the music is from Danny Elfman.</p>

<p>A nice poster and Sharon Stone as lead got my attention on the eerie library of Plex. But it was two years before her breakthrough in <em>Total Recall</em> then <em>Basic Instinct</em>, thanks to Paul Verhoeven. So in 1988, she was playing in smaller productions, to say the least, but I wasn’t prepared for a TV movie. <em>Tears in the Rain</em> (no connection with <em>Blade Runner</em>) is a Harlequin Romance TV film telling the story of an American learning about her late mother’s past in England. Twists are hackneyed and directing feels amateurish: it’s as if they never bothered doing more than one take.</p>
<p>Sharon Stone is the only highlight. She acted in two other films this year, so I might talk about her again.</p>

<div class="credits">directed by Edouard Molinaro</div>
<p>A typical French Vaudeville filmed theatre play. With the typical 80s gratuitous nudity and borderline racist black characters.<br>
If you want to watch it, it’s for the trio of actors: Pierre Richard deploys his great comedic timing, Richard Bohringer is so intense and Emmanuelle Béart is crazy young.<br>
Produced by Claude Berri, he was the godfather of the French cinema. Famous director, but I know him mostly for his zillions productions.</p>

<p>Surprisingly very good and aged well. We are far way from the road trip of <em>Easy Rider</em> (1969) and more in the hoods of Los Angeles, but the violence of the US society is still the main topic.<br>
Made me think a lot of <em>The Wire</em> (2002), especially the character played by Don Cheadle: he has a small role but looks a lot like Omar.<br>
Who can’t say no to a buddy movie when the two actors are lovable: Robert Duval is always great and Sean Penn is playing well the young, obnoxious hot shot.</p>
<p>That’s a film that stays in your mind days after watching it.</p>
<h2 class="with-credits" data-content='Buster'>Buster</h2>
<div class="credits">directed by David Green</div>
<p>Advertised as a comedy on <em>Arte</em>, I was expected more humour than this light, but dramatic, story based on a true event.<br>
Besides the surprising main actor, Phil Collins, the depiction of the Great Train Robbery, happening in a 1963 England, is forgettable.<br>
Like for <a href="/posts/cinema-88-disney-plus-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Cocktail</em></a> and its song <em>Kokomo</em>, I will remember the (even more cheesy) song written by Phil Collins for the film: <em>Loco in Acapulco</em> by the Four Tops.</p>
<p>Fun fact, the film is scored by Anne Dudley, who is a huge name in the music industry. I didn’t know she wrote so many soundtracks: <em>The Full Monty</em>, <em>American History X</em>, <em>Les Misérables</em> and all the late Paul Verhoeven’s films.</p>
