  <p>Better later than never, let’s go back to last year’s art production.</p>
<h2 data-content='Cinema'>Cinema</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/2019awards/booksmart.jpg" alt="Booksmart"></p>
<p>I watched 114,5 films this year (the half is because I didn't know <em>Woodstock</em> was 5h 30m when I entered the cinema) including <a href="https://www.senscritique.com/top/Les_meilleurs_films_de_2019/2348325">33 released in 2019</a> and a lot of great classics.</p>
<p>🏆 <strong>Booksmart</strong><br>
Perfect, love it.</p>
<p>I confess my enthusiasm has decreased a bit since but I was really into it for a month. It was the first time I was able to watch a movie on streaming (Netflix) after seeing it in cinema and I did, multiple times.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are amazing. The tension builds up leads to an exultant finale, the best you can expect from a Tarantino film.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Avengers Endgame</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The climax of an unprecedented shared universe list of films. I admit I got the chills, I cried and yelled with all the movie theatre.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ad Astra</em></li>
</ul>
<p>What an odd mix, kind of a personal, introspect, pulp space adventure. I was blown away just at the cinematography (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0887227/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr20">Hoyte Van Hoytema</a>) of some scenes. The music, with tracks from Max Richter (damn!), also moved me.</p>
<p>I'm missing good space opera nowadays! Too bad the last part is too ridiculous.</p>
<h3>Mentions</h3>
<p>I want to cite many more films that I all liked for their uniqueness:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>J'ai perdu mon corps</em></li>
<li><em>Art of selft defense</em></li>
<li><em>Marriage story</em></li>
<li><em>Parasite</em></li>
<li><em>Mid 90's</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 data-content='TV'>TV</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/2019awards/watchmen.jpg" alt="Watchmen"></p>
<p>🏆 <strong>Watchmen</strong><br>
What a tour de force! The sequel of a cult and complex comics that respect the original material by being as controversial. Playing with the TV media and the audience like the graphic novel did.</p>
<p>An A-class world-building. Smart Easter eggs. Interesting extra content for the community. It's a masterclass. The <a href="https://www.hbo.com/watchmen/watchmen-listen-to-official-podcast">official podcast</a> with Damon Lindelof himself is indicative of the passion and work provided.</p>
<p>I loved the work on transitions in the first episodes.</p>
<p>For the third time, Lindelof delivers an outstanding show, and soundtrack: this time with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, but Max Richter and Michael Giacchino did it before.</p>
<h3>Mentions</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>The Good Place</em> S3<br>
Oh my god! The final moral is following me every day. Best sci-fi show, best ethics show.</li>
<li><em>Love, Death &amp; Robots</em><br>
Varying quality but one ground breaking short: <em>The Witness</em> (and <em>Zima</em> is beautiful)</li>
<li><em>Russian Doll</em></li>
<li><em>Carole &amp; Tuesday</em></li>
<li><em>Star Trek Discovery</em> S2</li>
<li><em>The Witcher</em></li>
<li><em>Sex education</em> S1<br>
Too many stupid plots but a <em>Freaks and Geeks</em> vibe! Mama Gillian is great.</li>
<li><em>Osmosis</em><br>
A tacky French sci-fi mixing all plots possible instead of focusing on its good initial idea but I could watch the soulless gaze of Agathe Bonitzer all day.</li>
</ul>

<h2 data-content='Music video'>Music video</h2>
<p>To be honest, at the end of the year, I had no idea which music videos to feature, except maybe this two from <em>-M-</em> (the so <em>Moulin Rouge</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmogU10aqkA"><em>Superchérie</em></a> and this impressive fake oner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kM6PwWeIaY"><em>Thérapie</em></a>).</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2019awards/hungry-child.jpg" alt="Hungry Child"></p>
<p>So I went hunting and found a bunch of interesting videos but 🏆 <a href="https://vimeo.com/328316012"><em>Hungry Child</em></a> from Saman Kesh for <em>Hot Chip</em> is the best one. I just finished Silicon Valley, so I'm surely biased, but the actors are great, the concept fun and the track cool.<br>
I'll continue to dig into Saman Kesh's work, this bit is also great: <a href="https://vimeo.com/72044971"><em>Too Many Friends</em></a> by <em>Placebo</em>.</p>
<h3>Mentions</h3>
<p><em>The Chemical Brothers</em>’ videos are always qualitative and 2019 is not an exception:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfSM-lv55I"><em>We’ve Got to Try</em></a> directed by Ninian Doff (also great videos for <a href="http://niniandoff.com/music-videos">Miike Snow</a>) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYwtllbweY"><em>Got To Keep On</em></a> directed by Michel Gondry &amp; Olivier Gondry, of course.</p>
<p>PUP had really stupid videos as well: a fan made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhhyrmF0C_s"><em>Free at Last</em></a> and a low-key sci-fi <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iVrOOCYD80"><em>Kids</em></a>.</p>
<p>In the category &quot;Film director still making music videos&quot;, Paul Tomas Anderson has a pretty strong game</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjuA_o6Jzyo"><em>Summer Girl</em></a> for <em>HAIM</em> is the most summery strip and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNYJ_BJJbzI"><em>Anima</em></a> with Thom Yorke is, less bathed in light, but impressive.</p>
<p>Finally, I love the camera work on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ClYy0MxsU0"><em>Vossi Bop</em></a> - Stormzy, the bullet time in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUQI-o02JYU"><em>Kids Turned Out Fine</em></a> - A$AP Rocky by Dexter Navy and this eerie moment in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qolmz4FlnZ0"><em>Doin’ Time</em></a> when giant Lana Del Rey (?) is dancing on the beach, on a driving cinema screen. Yeah.</p>
<h2 data-content='Video'>Video</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zJE3iuNIgM">HOOD COWBOY BEBOP by King Vader</a></p>
<p>Best <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> adaptation. This left-right camera move is killing me every time, reminds me this too short FX during the final fight scene of <em>Elysium</em> by Neill Blomkamp.</p>
<h2 data-content='Music'>Music</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Lettre infinie</em> - -M-</li>
<li><em>No Geography</em> - Chemical Brothers</li>
<li><em>Watchmen</em> and <em>mid90s</em> - Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross</li>
<li><em>Metronomy for Ever</em> and <em>Nights Out (10th Anniversary Edition)</em> (<em>Over</em> track 👌) - Metronomy</li>
<li><em>Better Oblivion Community Center</em></li>

<h2 data-content='Video game trailer'>Video game trailer</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/2019awards/flight-simulator.jpg" alt="Microsoft Flight Simulator"></p>
<p>Can I be disappointed that the best video game trailer of the year is for a flight simulator? Yes, I am but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCBgO6St9ug">X019 - Gameplay Trailer</a> is still amazing. The music, the edit and, of course, the fraking graphics from the upcoming 🏆 <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em>, by the French <em>Asobo</em>, **are moving. And they are already getting back at it with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQFmpakz9Yo">Let it snow!</a> trailer in 2020.</p>
<h3>Mentions</h3>
<p>I really feel I missed something but the best <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> trailer was last year despite the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIcTM8WXFjk">Official Cinematic Trailer E3 2019</a>. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fr1Z07AV00">Breath of the Wild Sequel</a> trailer caused a sensation but is lazy. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-As1OGqJkU"><em>Control</em></a> has an astonishing art direction and trailers had nothing to do to show it.</p>
<p><em>Deathloop</em> was a nice surprise from the Arkane Lyon and its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXv5IDp8y74">E3 2019 trailer</a> is solid.</p>
<p><em>Death Stranding</em> is out-of-category, more than one trailer, it's the 3-year campaign led by Kojima's videos that I want to celebrate.</p>
<p>I loved the introduction of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmDTu8NPrw"><em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> Banjo-Kazooie Official Trailer - E3 2019</a> and all their characters’ videos are entertaining.</p>
<p>I almost forgot the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl7YKppgaiY">Official Announcement Trailer</a> for <em>Humankind</em> from the Frenchies Amplitude, with a crazy cover of the <em>Toccata and Fugue in D Minor</em> by Bach, maybe from FlyByNO ¯*(ツ)*/¯</p>
<p>And there was a trailer for a new Half-life game but it's not fun, contrary to this French gem, worst, but funny, dub of the year: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUP18IU3MEc"><em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> - Vidéo de présentation</a></p>
<h2 data-content='Video game'>Video game</h2>
<p>Still difficult to follow the video game calendar but I’ve caught up on <a href="https://www.senscritique.com/liste/Jeux_termines_en_2019/2574598">some good games this year</a>. I finished <em>Life is Strange</em>, among others. That pushed me to listen to even more of <em>Syd Matters</em> music, always a pleasure.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2019awards/tetris.jpg" alt="Tetris 99"></p>
<p>🏆 <strong>Tetris 99</strong></p>
<p>A bit like the late <em>1 vs. 100</em>, it's a bloody last man standing but playing <em>Tetris</em>. The oldest perfect game design matching with the latest trend, the battle royale. So smart. The execution and choice of distribution are also very good and unexpected.</p>
<h3>Mentions</h3>
<p><a href="http://meditations.games/"><em>Meditations</em></a> was a superb idea but felt short, with me, because the few games I tried were more depressing and frustrating than relaxing.</p>
<p><em>Pokemon Shield</em> was a nice throwback to <a href="http://archives.thenew.fr/2000-pokegames">my late Pokemon days</a> but the game is from another age, it’s baffling.</p>
<p>But it was the <strong>Xbox Game Pass</strong> year for me, the offer is ridiculously good and it's coming to PC. I discovered the excellent <em>Slay the Spire</em>.<br>
I loved the aesthetics of <em>Void Bastards</em> but didn't follow up, cf my relation with rogue likes in last year's awards.<br>
I'm playing <em>A Plague Tale : Innocence</em>, I've started <em>Outer Wilds</em> but haven't been hooked, I'll retry.</p>
<p>And I definitely want to play <em>Death Stranding</em>, <em>Disco Elysium, Control</em> and maybe <em>Baba is You</em> if I feel smart enough.</p>
